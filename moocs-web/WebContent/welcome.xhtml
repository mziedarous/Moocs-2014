to traditional course materials such as videos, readings, and problem sets, MOOCs provide interactive 
user forums that help build course materials such as videos, readings, and problem sets, 
MOOCs provide interactive user forums that help build a community for students, professors, 
and teaching assistants (TAs). MOOCs are a recent development in distance education Although early MOOCs
 often emphasized open access features, such as connectivism and open licensing of content, structure, and
 learning goals, to promote the reuse and remixing of resources, some notable newer MOOCs use closed licenses for their course materials,
 while maintaining free access for students.
